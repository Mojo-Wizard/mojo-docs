# About This Project

I bought this domain with grand plans to launch an open-source, community-maintained Mojo documentation site. Before anything shipped, I realized the Modular community had already built an excellent, community-owned version. Rather than compete or let the domain gather dust, I pivoted this project into a companion hub with three simple rules:

- **Curate instead of clone.** Point people to the best official docs, explain what each link covers, and sprinkle in notes so you know whether it’s worth the click.
- **Talk like a human.** The language might be high performance, but the person reading it is probably in a hoodie at midnight. Expect plain English, occasional jokes, and real-world motivation.
- **Stay flexible.** Today it’s a list of useful links. Tomorrow it could host learning paths, experiments, or GPU playground ideas. Whatever keeps the Mojo story moving forward.

## Independence

This site is **not** affiliated with Modular. It is just a fan-made hub that gets updated whenever I learn something new or someone from the community sends a better resource. Corrections and contributions are welcome-open an issue, drop a link, or write your own blurb.

## Want to help?

- Share resources you love so I can keep the link list fresh.
- File PRs with your own commentary or new sections.
- Spread the word to anyone asking, “Where do I even start with Mojo?”

If Modular’s official docs are the encyclopedia, this is the friendly zine taped to the wall next to your desk. Enjoy the vibe and use it as a launchpad to the real docs when you need deep dives.

## Where this is heading

- Short learning paths that stitch together the best official chapters with extra context.
- Case-study writeups on Python interop, GPU kernels, and MAX experiments.
- Possibly a tiny Mojo playground or notebook gallery once the tooling is ready.

If any of that sounds fun (or if you have better ideas), open an issue and let’s see where it goes.
