# About This Project

I bought this domain planning to publish a full, community-maintained Mojo documentation set. Before the first draft even shipped, I found Modular’s community-owned docs - and they were already fantastic. That discovery changed the mission: instead of rebuilding the same thing, this site became the place that **curates** those official resources, adds context, and experiments with new ideas as the ecosystem grows.

## What this hub stands for

- **Curate instead of clone.** Every page highlights why a given Modular doc matters and when you should read it.
- **Talk like a human.** Explanations are written the way people actually speak when pairing or chatting on Discord.
- **Keep evolving.** Today you get quick blurbs and a community project directory. Tomorrow you might find learning paths, GPU playground drafts, or deep dives hosted by maintainers.

## Independent and community-driven

This site isn’t affiliated with Modular. It’s a fan project that gets updates whenever I learn something new or someone from the community shares a better explanation. If you notice anything inaccurate - or have a resource worth shouting about - open an issue or PR.

## How you can help

1. Share links or commentary that clarified Mojo for you.
2. Add your project to the [Projects](/projects) page, propose a Community Guide, or host a full write-up inside the Project Docs section.
3. Suggest ideas that would make this hub more useful than a bookmark folder.

If Modular’s official docs are the encyclopedia, this is the zine taped next to your monitor. Use it as a launchpad, and feel free to scribble in the margins.
