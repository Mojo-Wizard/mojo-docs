# Community & blog highlights

**What it is:** A quick pointer to Modular’s blog, announcements, and community hangouts.

- **Modular blog** - [modular.com/blog](https://www.modular.com/blog). Long-form articles about roadmap updates, design decisions, and feature launches.
- **Discord server** - [discord.gg/modular](https://discord.gg/modular). Real-time Q&A with the Mojo and MAX community, plus office-hour recordings.
- **Release spotlights** - Most blog posts link to GitHub release notes or videos that show new features in action; use them as visual companions to the docs.

**Why read it:**

- Blog posts provide the “why” behind roadmap changes, which rarely fit into reference docs.
- Discord is where bug confirmations and early tips surface before formal docs get updated.
