# Overview

Welcome! I grabbed this domain planning to build an open-source, community-maintained Mojo doc site. Once I discovered Modular already runs an excellent, community-owned version, I kept the domain and turned it into a **curated hub** that tells you which official pages to read and why. Think of it as a concierge desk: pick a topic, skim a quick blurb, and hop straight to the source.

## How to use this hub

1. Scroll through the sections below or use the sidebar.
2. Each entry summarizes **what the doc covers**, **why you should care**, and **the link to the canonical version**.
3. Come back whenever you need a refresher or a friend’s recommendation on where to start.

## Mojo Language

- [Language basics & overview](./modular-language-basics) - why the official manual is worth your time.
