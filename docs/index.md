# Mojo Docs

Welcome! I grabbed this domain planning to build an open-source, community-maintained Mojo doc site. Once I discovered Modular already runs an excellent, community-owned version, I kept the domain and turned it into a **curated hub** that tells you which official pages to read and why. Think of it as a concierge desk: pick a topic, skim a quick blurb, and hop straight to the source.

## How to use this hub
1. Scroll through the sections below or use the sidebar.
2. Each entry summarizes **what the doc covers**, **why you should care**, and **the link to the canonical version**.
3. Come back whenever you need a refresher or a friend’s recommendation on where to start.

### Document collections
- [Language basics & overview](./modular-language-basics) — why the official manual is worth your time.
- [Standard library deep dive](./modular-standard-library) — quick notes on core types and helpers.
- [MAX AI & GPU kernels](./modular-max-ai) — where to learn about LayoutTensor, linalg, and kernels.
- [Tooling, releases, and CLI tips](./modular-tools) — keeping up with the CLI and release notes.
- [Community & blog highlights](./community-and-blog) — stay in the loop with Modular’s updates.

If you have a favorite resource that belongs here, open an issue. This page stays intentionally small so you always know where to click next.
