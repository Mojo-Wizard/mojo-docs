# Tooling, releases, and CLI

**What it is:** The [Mojo tools and release notes](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/tools/) section that explains the `mojo` CLI, package workflows, testing, and version history.

**Why read it:**

- You learn how `mojo run`, `mojo test`, and `mojo package` behave so you can script projects correctly.
- Release notes highlight breaking changes or new syntax that might catch you off guard.
- It’s the best place to track platform support (macOS, Linux, container images, etc.).

**Tips before you click:**

- Check release notes before updating your toolchain-some builds target specific OS versions.
- Review the testing page if you plan to run Mojo in CI.
- Bookmark the installation instructions for teammates who are onboarding.
