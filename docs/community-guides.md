# Overview

Community Guides is where we collect **learning material written by the Mojo community** - tutorials, “by example” books, deep dives, checklists, and any other resource that helps someone actually learn the language. These guides may live on personal blogs or GitHub gists; this hub simply summarizes why they’re useful, how current they are, and where to find them.

Use this section when you want:

- A narrative walkthrough (e.g., Mojo by Example, GPU primers, ownership cheat sheets).
- A curated set of exercises or puzzles.
- Seasoned notes from folks who already ported Python, Rust, or CUDA projects into Mojo.

## How to add a guide

1. Open an issue (or PR) describing:
   - Guide title & author
   - Where the content lives (URL, repository)
   - Why it’s valuable (what audience, what topics)
   - Any caveats (outdated chapters, experimental APIs)
2. Add a Markdown file underneath `docs/community-guides/` (you can nest folders if you want a multi-page guide). Keep the tone conversational but always link to the original source.
3. Update `sidebars.js` so the guide is visible in the Community Guides category.

The goal is to celebrate community teaching. If you already maintain an excellent guide, surface it here so readers can discover it quickly, and so we can track its freshness over time.
