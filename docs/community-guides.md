# Overview

I eventually want this hub to spotlight write-ups created by the community: how real projects structure their Mojo code, how they integrate with Python, and what lessons popped up along the way. That content belongs here - not hidden behind yet another repo README.

## How this section will work

Each project gets its own short page that covers:

- What the project does and why it exists.
- Links to the canonical docs or repo.
- Notes from the maintainers (what went well, rough edges, tuning tricks).
- Any “read this next” recommendations so readers know where to dive deeper.

Those pages will live alongside this overview once contributions land.

## Want your guide featured?

1. Open an issue (or PR) in this repository with:
   - Project name and repo link.
   - Category (the same one you’d use for the [Projects directory](/projects)).
   - A short outline describing the sections you want to add.
2. Once we align on scope, submit a pull request that adds a `.md` file under `docs/community-guides/` (feel free to nest folders if the project needs multiple pages).
3. Link back to your canonical docs or website. This hub is a curator, not a replacement.

If you already maintain great docs, that’s perfect - add context here so people know why they should read yours. The goal is to celebrate the community’s best knowledge and make it simple to discover.
