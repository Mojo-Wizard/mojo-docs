# Language basics & overview

**What it is:** Modular’s official [Language basics](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) section. It covers syntax, ownership rules, `fn` vs `def`, modules, structs, and the mental model for writing idiomatic Mojo.

**Why read it:**

- You get the most up-to-date reference straight from the community-maintained manual.
- Each chapter mirrors the progression Python or Rust developers expect, so it works as a crash course.
- The examples stay aligned with the current toolchain releases.

**Tips before you click:**

- Skim the overview first to grab the vocabulary. Mojo borrows ideas from Rust and Swift, and the docs explain those terms early.
- If you already know the language basics, jump to the ownership and lifetimes chapters-they answer 90% of the “why does this move?” questions.
